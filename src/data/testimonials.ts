With every addition we added to the project (shelves in the boxing in for instance), it was never a problem and a solution was found so that we were happy with the end result. In terms of quality of work we couldn't fault it, the tiling is a real standout! Anyone else looking to get their bathroom refitted then look no further.",

      "We just wanted to thank you for the excellent job you carried out on our new kitchen. As you know our original kitchen was extremely tired and dated but you have transformed it beyond recognition. We especially appreciated your friendly yet professional approach and attention to detail, which was very important to us, being quite fussy customers! Your knowledge and advice was invaluable in making the best out of a fairly small space, but the end result feels so much more airy, clean and spacious. It was also very convenient for us that we were able to entrust you with a key to our house to complete the work which did not disrupt the running of our own business. We would have absolutely no hesitation in recommending you to others.",
